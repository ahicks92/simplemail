CHANGE LOG
***********

3/26/2015
Created the following tempaltes:
base.html (the base tempalte all others will inherit from)
base_main.html (inherits from base, used to setup the framework of the main application pages to be implemented)
base_application.html (inherits from base_main. Provides the implementation of the application)

Created the following html pages:
index.html (extends the base page. This will be what users see when they enter the main url, for now its localhost:8000, its used as a landing page for the application. It will give users a brief description and provide buttons for login/register)
login.html (provides the where with a login form and registration button, login works however redirection still needs implementing for both successful login and registration)
view_message.html (displays the message, currently just a framework. Needs more implementation)
inbox.html (had the file extend the base_application.html template, still needs styling)

Created the following stylesheets:
index.css (The styling for the homepage, index.html)
login.css (The styling for the login page)
style.css (The styling for the main application)

Changed the following views
views.py
def view_message(request,message_id)
-- changed it so this view gets the email associated with a message id, then converts it to a django dictionary? and then gets the message body which becomes the context of the view to be returned
-- This was implemented as a test for the view message view. I believe this should be implemented in the Email model. This way the context can be the email itself so in the template I can grab all the necessary fields and format the message correctly

We now have:
-Email.body, containing the body of the e-mail as text.
-email.body_stripped, containing the stripped body.  This is the body without the signature part and is something that mailgun sometimes gives.
- Email.signature containing the signature block, if any.  This is also only given to us sometimes, it's set to "" if we don't have it

I anticipate that we will only use body, but it was easiest to add them all now.

In addition, it's now request.user.profile and request.user.profile.emails, which is way cleaner.

And the view for displaying a message works with models.
